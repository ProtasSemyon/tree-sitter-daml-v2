     * The first one is a regular function with some redundant parens, where `fun` is the declared name.
     * The second one is a pattern binder with a view pattern, where `fun` is a free variable.
     * The third one is an infix pattern binder, where `fun` is a simple varid pattern with redundant parens.
     *
     * These conflicts are also relevant for top-level expression splices, which fundamentally conflict with decls, and
     * since decls start with either `var` or `pat`, they cannot be disambiguated.
     *
     * GHC parses functions and binds as expressions and sorts them into the right LHS in a post-processing step.
     * Since this is not possible in tree-sitter, these conflicts are more function-centric than in GHC.
